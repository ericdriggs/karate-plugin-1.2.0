= karate plugin for karate 1.2.0


== Issues


1. Cannot run code using karate plugin if karate 1.2.0 (hangs on `DEBUG com.intuit.karate.Suite - [config] classpath:karate-config.js`)

* Not being able to run code is a blocker for maintaining existing code still on karate 1.2.0

2. Cannot debug code using karate 1.2.0
* lower priority but would still be desirable

* Can live with only being able to debug >=1.3 or >=1.4


3. Unable to successfully register previous versions of plugin which might be compatible with karate 1.2.0

* Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> Karate

** expected: Signed in as Eric Driggs | Products: [PRO]
** actual: Signed in as Eric Driggs | Products: []

* Run/debug fail due to requiring pro version, actual products []




== Workarounds attempted

* download previous versions of plugin

** was not able to register previous versions of plugin. registration said successful, but
